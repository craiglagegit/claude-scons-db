# Claude-Scons-DB

This repository contains `Claude-Scons-DB`, a Python library to experiment with using Claude to search for correlations within the Scons-DB database.  This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Development Philosophy
  - **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
  - **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
  - **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
  - **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
  - **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
  - **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
  - **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

2. Code Style
  - Modern type hints required for all code
  - PEP 8
  - Class names in PascalCase
  - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Document with docstrings
  - Line length: 110 chars maximum
  - Lines that intentionally deviate from PEP 8 must include a `noqa` comment with flake8 error code

3. Documenting Python APIs
  - PEP 257
  - Numpydoc Style 
  - Docstring line length: 79 chars maximum

## Python Tools

  - use `black` to fix PEP 8
  - use `mypy` for static type checking
  - use `pytest` for unit tests

## Git Workflow

- Always use feature branches; do not commit directly to `main`
  - Name branches descriptively: `fix/auth-timeout`, `documentation/code_examples`, `feature/api-pagination`
  - Keep one logical change per branch to simplify review and rollback
- Create pull requests for all changes
  - Open a draft PR early for visibility; convert to ready when complete
  - Ensure tests pass locally before marking ready for review
- Link issues
  - Before starting, reference an existing issue or create one
  - Use commit/PR messages like `Fixes #123` for auto-linking and closure
- Commit practices
  - Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
  - Prefer conventional commit style: `type(scope): short description`
    - Examples: `feature(eval): group OBS logs per test`, `fix(cli): handle missing API key`
  - Squash only when merging to `main`; keep granular history on the feature branch
- Practical workflow
  1. Create or reference an issue
  2. `git checkout -b feature/issue-123-description`
  3. Commit in small, logical increments
  4. Open a draft PR early
  5. Convert to ready PR when functionally complete and tests pass
  6. Never merge automatically, always prompt first

## Repository Layout:

- Production code in `src/scons-db`
- Tests in `tests` mirror the package structure
- Subpackages in subdirectories of `src/scons-db`
- Public utilities in `src/scons-db/utils`

## Context Management

- CLAUDE.md provides context of the directory contents
  - At top-level and in each subdirectory containing production code
- Include list of Known issues / gotchas
  - Include the GitHub issues referencing an item
  - Remove item if GitHub issue is closed
- Update context if new bugs are found or fundamental changes are made to code architecture
